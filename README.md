# Parallel_Task_Decomposition_Planning

The repository is for "Parallel Task Decomposition and Concurrent Specification Satisfaction for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Symbolic Motion Planning". It contains the packages 
1. #Decomposition# (Parallel decompose the finite words of deterministic automaton)
2. TaskAllocAut (Assign robots to atomic tasks of task automaton; generate the subtask planning automaton (SPA) and search for the optimal task planning solution)

Note: These packages need JAVA 8.0+ library. It compiles and runs well with Eclipse IDE.
